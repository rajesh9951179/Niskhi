          <p style={paragraphStyle}>
            We at Baise Gaba ("Baise Gaba" "we," "us," or "our") know that our users ("you," "your," or "yourself") care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By visiting or using the www.baisegaba.com website and domain name, any other linked pages, features, content, mobile applications, and any other services we offer from time to time in connection with any of the foregoing (collectively, the "Website"), you agree to the practices and policies set forth in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby acknowledge and consent to our collection, use, and sharing of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given to them in our Terms of Use.
          </p>

          <h4 style={subheadingTextStyle}>WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</h4>
          <p style={paragraphStyle}>
            This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that we gather when you are accessing or using our Website. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage, even if you have accessed the websites or services of those companies through our Website.We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from  anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the  Services (as that term is defined in our Terms of Use). If you are under 13,  please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any information  about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email  address. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to us or  on the Services. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a  child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that  information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any  information from or about a child under 13, please contact us  at support@baisegaba.com .
          </p>
          <h4 style={subheadingTextStyle}>INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US: </h4>
          <p style={paragraphStyle}>
          We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For  example, we collect Personal Information such as your name, username, phone  number, credit card and other billing information, email address, shipping  address, and your friendsʼ email addresses (which we will only use in order to  invite them to use the Service), and your third-party account credentials (for  example, your log-in credentials for Facebook). We may also collect  information you supply to us regarding your personal preferences and  interests. If you access the Service through Facebook Connect , you  understand that some content and/or information in your Facebook account  (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with  us if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account  Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy. You  can choose not to provide us with any or all of the information we specify or  request, but then you may not be able to register with us or to take advantage  of some or all of our features. We may anonymize your Personal Information so  that you cannot be individually identified and provide that anonymized  information to our partners. For example, we allow advertisers to choose the  demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and you  agree that we may use any of the information we have collected from you in  non-personally identifiable form to allow our advertisers to select the  appropriate audience for those advertisements. We might use the fact you  have purchased or inquired about a certain brand of apparel, for instance, to  show you advertisements for the company that sells that brand, but we will not  tell that company who you are. 
          </p>
          <h4 style={subheadingTextStyle}>INFORMATION COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY:</h4>
          <p style={paragraphStyle}>
          • Whenever you interact with our Website, we automatically receive and  record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP  address, “cookie” information, and the page you requested. “Cookies” are  identifiers we transfer to your computer or device that allow us to  recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages in our  Website are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change  the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your  computerʼs or deviceʼs acceptance of cookies, but doing so may prevent  you from taking advantage of our Websiteʼs best features. Our advertising  partners may transmit cookies to your computer or device when you click  on ads that appear on our site. This Privacy Policy does not cover cookies  delivered to you by any of our advertisers. 
         </p>
         <p style={paragraphStyle}>
         •  When we collect usage information (such as the numbers and frequency of  visitors to the Website and to which pages within the Website), we only use  such data in aggregate form, in a manner that assures your anonymity. We  may provide this aggregate usage information to our partners; our  partners may use such information to understand how often and in what  ways people use our Website, so that our partners, too, can endeavor to  provide you with an optimal online experience. For example, we may place  a cookie on your device that records what products you have viewed on our Website, and then provide that information, in non-personally identifiable form, to a third party website, to allow such website to show  you ads for similar products that are available from us or from third  parties.
         </p>
         <p style={paragraphStyle}>
         •  We may also deliver a file to you through the Website (known as a "web  beacon") from an advertising network we have contracted with. Web  beacons allow advertising networks to provide anonymized, aggregated  auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons  also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you  visit other websites. These beacons may, for example, log that you have  viewed a certain product on our Website, and then show you an ad for  similar products when you browse to another website. Because your web  browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad  network's servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own  cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. Many ad  networks participate in the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"), a  cooperative of online marketing and analytics companies committed to  building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and  data management practices and standards, and such NAI members may  allow you to opt-out of cookies or beacons they deliver. Again, we do not  control the policies of any third parties, including advertising networks.     
         </p>
         <h4 style={subheadingTextStyle}>WE-MAIL AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS: </h4>
         <p style={paragraphStyle}>
         •  We may contact you, by email or other means. For example, we may send you  promotional offers on behalf of other businesses, or communicate with you  about your use of the Website. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you  open an email from us. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from  us, please indicate your preference by changing your account settings  accordingly. WILL BAISE GABA SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION  IT RECEIVES? We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information in personally  identifiable form to anyone. We share your Personal Information in personally  identifiable form with third parties only as described below: 
         </p>
         <h4 style={subheadingTextStyle}>AFFILIATED BUSINESSES AND THIRD PARTY WEBSITES WE DO  NOT CONTROL:  </h4>
         <p style={paragraphStyle}>
         In certain situations, businesses or third party websites weʼre affiliated with  may sell items or provide services to you through the Website (either alone or  jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated  with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information  with that affiliated business only to the extent that we deem it related to such  transaction or service. One such service may include the ability for you to  automatically transmit information from youʼre the loom account to an account  on a third party website or service, such as Facebook. We have no control over  the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy  or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service  relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such businessʼs  or websitesʼ policies.
         </p>
         <h4 style={subheadingTextStyle}>AGENTS: </h4>
         <p style={paragraphStyle}>
         We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and  need to share your information with them to provide products or services to  you. Unless we inform you otherwise, our agents do not have any right to use  the Personal Information we share with them beyond what we deem necessary  to assist us in performing such tasks. 
         </p>
         <h4 style={subheadingTextStyle}>USER PROFILES AND CONTENT: </h4>
         <p style={paragraphStyle}>
         Certain user profile information, including without limitation a userʼs username  and the image content that such user has uploaded to the website may be  displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Website or  address your request for our services. Any content you upload to your public  user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily  disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in  messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be  collected and used by others. Your username may also be displayed to other  users if and when you post comments or upload images through the Website  and other users can contact you through such comments. If you sign into the  Services through Facebook Connect, your list of “friends” from Facebook may  be automatically imported to the Services, and such “friends,” if they are also  registered users of the Services, may be able to access certain non-public  information you have entered in your Services user profile. Again, we do not  control the policies and practices of any other third party site or service.
         </p>
         <h4 style={subheadingTextStyle}>BUSINESS TRANSFERS: </h4>
         <p style={paragraphStyle}>
         We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer  information (which may include your Personal Information) is typically one of  the business assets that is transferred. Also, if we (or substantially all of our  assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, Personal  Information would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third  party. 
         </p>
         <h4 style={subheadingTextStyle}>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION CAN I ACCESS?  </h4>
         <p style={paragraphStyle}>
         Through your account settings, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or  delete the following information youʼve provided to us:
         </p>
         <p style={paragraphStyle}>
         •  Your Name And Password
         </p>
         <p style={paragraphStyle}>
         • Email address shipping and billing information 
         </p>
         <p style={paragraphStyle}>
         • User profile information and User Content, including images you have  uploaded to the site  
         </p>
         <p style={paragraphStyle}>
         The information you can view and update may change as the Website  changes. If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we  have on file about you, please contact us at support@baisegaba.com

         </p>
         <h4 style={subheadingTextStyle}>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY  </h4>
         <p style={paragraphStyle}>
         We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we  collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such  information is used. If we make changes in the way we use Personal  Information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on our Website or  contacting you directly via email or other means.
